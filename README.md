# swordle

This project is a spinoff of wordle where you must guess soccer players by name.
The "topfive.csv" file contains the names, position, nationality, club and league of 
players in Europes top five leagues during the 2021-22 season. 
This game works in the terminal and you get 5 guesses total to figure out the randomly 
selected player. After every guess you will see if the position, nationality, club and/or league 
of your guessed player match that of the target.
